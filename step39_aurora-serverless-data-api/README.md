## Using the Data API for Aurora Serverless

By using the Data API for Aurora Serverless, you can work with a web-services interface to your Aurora Serverless DB cluster. The Data API doesn't require a persistent connection to the DB cluster. Instead, it provides a secure HTTP endpoint and integration with AWS SDKs. You can use the endpoint to run SQL statements without managing connections.
