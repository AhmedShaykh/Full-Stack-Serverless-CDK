## AWS CDK

[AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) is an open source software development framework to model and provision your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages. With AWS CDK, you can define your infrastructure as code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. AWS CDK is available to use in all AWS regions. In this learning repo we will use CDK with TypeScript.

[What is the AWS CDK?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html)

We expect that Open Source AWS CDK will become the defacto standard for Infrastructure as Code (IAC) not just for AWS but other clouds as well. Thus becoming the standard IAC multicloud tool. It is already available for [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk) and [Kubernetes](https://cdk8s.io/). CDK has already become the de facto software development framework internally at AWS. AWS CDK is DevOps for Developers and is the Ultimate DevOps tool.

## Full Stack Serverless

In this repository we are going to cover and learn Full Stack Serverless App Development from this [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/full-stack-serverless/9781492059882/) and build the apps using AWS CDK.

We are also going to learn designing, developing, and deploying advanced serverless applications and API from this [Learning Serverless Book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-serverless/9781492057000/) and implement them using AWS CDK.

## Learn to Build Multi-Tenant Serverless SaaS API's

Once we have mastered the above technologies we will learn how to develop multi-tenanted SaaS API's and applications.
