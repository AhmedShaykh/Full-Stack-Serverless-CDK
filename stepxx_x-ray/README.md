# Introduction

AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your applicationâ€™s underlying components. You can use X-Ray to analyze both applications in development and in production, from simple three-tier applications to complex microservices applications consisting of thousands of services.


# How does AWS X-Ray works?
#### X-Ray helps answer three critical questions
1. **How** is my application doing?
2. **Why** is my application performing the way it is?
3. **Who** is impacted by the issues?
